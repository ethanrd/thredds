* thredds.catalog2 work
** Current log of activity
*** 2014-02-02
- Compare Catalog classes to Service classes
*** 2014-01-27
- Start "fresh" in clcommon with package ucar.thredds.catalog
  - Limit initial work to Catalog
** Current actions
*** TODO Consolidate checkForIssues() as utility that impls can use
*** TODO When set isBuildable to DONT_KNOW, also set buildIssues to null
- So only carrying around buildIssues incase build(), release them once can't build()
*** TODO Hide CatalogWideService*Tracker in Service*Container
*** TODO Add handling for next XML element
**** XML elements
- [x] Catalog
- [x] Property
- [ ] Service  1) [x], 2) [x], 3) [x], 4) [x], 5) [ ] need to test
- [ ] Access
- [ ] DatasetNode
**** Steps for each XML element
1) copy node and builder
2) copy impls (and any containers)
3) Add to ThreddsBuilderFactory
4) copy Builder (and any container) tests and get them running
5) Add containers (if needed) and test them
6) Add use of new node/builder in parent nodes/builders (e.g., add Property to Catalog)
7) Add tests for new child elements
8) copy XML names, parsers, and writers
9) copy add parser/writer tests, add to CatalogXmlAsStringUtils and ThreddsCompareUtils
*** TODO Write impl agnostic Builder/Node tests
*** TODO Write impl specific Builder/Node tests
*** TODO Write impl and parser agnostic tests
*** TODO Ensure consistency throughout classes

- Checklist (matching columns above)
  1) this.isBuildable, isBuildable():Buildable
  2) checkForIssues():BuilderIssues
  3) Set this.isBuildable = Buildable.DONT_KNOW whenever state
     changed
  4) All Builder properties and elements are mutable
  5) All Builder URL usage is as String
  6) non-Builder's are as final as possible
  7) non-Builder's are serializable

** Old notes, still relevant
- Done in previous changes
  - Start using BuilderIssue(s) more widely.
  - Remove URI from Builders so can handle bad URI strings gracefully.
  - Split the Catalog XML utils out from the parser utils (already in thredds.catalog.xml.testutil)
- Current: straightimpl2, second attempt at straightimpl
  - [X] Copy simpleimpl to straightimpl2
  - [X] Update all Property* classes to match straightimpl
  - [X] Copy ImmutableBuilderIssueContainer over from straightimpl
  - [X] Add GlobalServiceBuilderContainer
  - [X] Some clean up of BuilderIssueContainer* classes
  - [X] Update GlobalService*Container to match strightimpl, with rename
  - [ ] Update all Service* classes and double check CatalogWideService*Tracker classes
  - [ ] Need to copy
  - [ ] In CatalogWideServiceBuilderTracker, switch from using List<> servicesWithDuplicateNames to using List<> allServices
- New changes:
  - [ ] Need to get things running so I can run tests! Need to test GlobalServiceContainer.removeService( service)
  - [x] Clean up BuilderIssue(s) and BuilderException
  - [ ] ThreddsBuilder:
    - [x] boolean isBuilt() ---> Buildable isBuildable()
    - [X] Buildable is enum (YES, NO, DONT_KNOW) // if DONT_KNOW, run checkForIssues() to determine
    - [x] BuilderIssues getIssues() --> BuilderIssues checkForIssues()
  - [ ] Add baseimpl
    - [ ] Move PropertyImpl and PropertyContainer to baseimpl
    - [ ] Move ThreddsCatalogIssueImpl to baseimple
  - [ ] Rename simpleimpl to combinedimpl for impl with builder/non-builder class
  - [X] Add straightimpl for impl with both builder and non-builder classes
  - [ ] In GlobalServiceContainer, switch from using List<> servicesWithDuplicateNames to using List<> allServices
- Future changes:
  - [ ] Don't implement ThreddsBuilder in Container classes but support other classes
- Tests
  - Can't add sub-services to a non-compound service
  - Can't add a service multiple times. Can add identical service multiple times.
  - There is always a rootServiceContainer
