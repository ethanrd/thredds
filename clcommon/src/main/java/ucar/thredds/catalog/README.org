* thredds.catalog2 work
** Current log of activity
*** 2014-02-02
- Compare Catalog classes to Service classes
*** 2014-01-27
- Start "fresh" in clcommon with package ucar.thredds.catalog
  - Limit initial work to Catalog
** Current actions
*** TODO Add handling for next XML element
- property
|      | property | service | dataset |
|------+----------+---------+---------|
| copy |          |         |         |
| test |          |         |         | 

- steps
  - copy node and builder
  - copy impls (and any containers)
  - Add to ThreddsBuilderFactory
  - copy Builder (and any container) tests and get them running
  - Add use of new node/builder in parent nodes/builders (e.g., add Property to Catalog)
  - Add tests for new child elements
  - copy XML names, parsers, and writers
  - copy add parser/writer tests, add to CatalogXmlAsStringUtils and ThreddsCompareUtils
*** TODO Write impl agnostic Builder/Node tests
*** TODO Write impl specific Builder/Node tests
*** TODO Write impl and parser agnostic tests
*** TODO Ensure consistency throughout classes

- Checklist (matching columns above)
  1) this.isBuildable, isBuildable():Buildable
  2) checkForIssues():BuilderIssues
  3) Set this.isBuildable = Buildable.DONT_KNOW whenever state
     changed
  4) All Builder properties and elements are mutable
  5) All Builder URL usage is as String
  6) non-Builder's are as final as possible
  7) non-Builder's are serializable

** Old notes, still relevant
- Done in previous changes
  - Start using BuilderIssue(s) more widely.
  - Remove URI from Builders so can handle bad URI strings gracefully.
  - Split the Catalog XML utils out from the parser utils (already in thredds.catalog.xml.testutil)
- Current: straightimpl2, second attempt at straightimpl
  - [X] Copy simpleimpl to straightimpl2
  - [X] Update all Property* classes to match straightimpl
  - [X] Copy ImmutableBuilderIssueContainer over from straightimpl
  - [X] Add GlobalServiceBuilderContainer
  - [X] Some clean up of BuilderIssueContainer* classes
  - [X] Update GlobalService*Container to match strightimpl, with rename
  - [ ] Update all Service* classes and double check CatalogWideService*Tracker classes
  - [ ] Need to copy
  - [ ] In CatalogWideServiceBuilderTracker, switch from using List<> servicesWithDuplicateNames to using List<> allServices
- New changes:
  - [ ] Need to get things running so I can run tests! Need to test GlobalServiceContainer.removeService( service)
  - [x] Clean up BuilderIssue(s) and BuilderException
  - [ ] ThreddsBuilder:
    - [x] boolean isBuilt() ---> Buildable isBuildable()
    - [X] Buildable is enum (YES, NO, DONT_KNOW) // if DONT_KNOW, run checkForIssues() to determine
    - [x] BuilderIssues getIssues() --> BuilderIssues checkForIssues()
  - [ ] Add baseimpl
    - [ ] Move PropertyImpl and PropertyContainer to baseimpl
    - [ ] Move ThreddsCatalogIssueImpl to baseimple
  - [ ] Rename simpleimpl to combinedimpl for impl with builder/non-builder class
  - [X] Add straightimpl for impl with both builder and non-builder classes
  - [ ] In GlobalServiceContainer, switch from using List<> servicesWithDuplicateNames to using List<> allServices
- Future changes:
  - [ ] Don't implement ThreddsBuilder in Container classes but support other classes
- Tests
  - Can't add sub-services to a non-compound service
  - Can't add a service multiple times. Can add identical service multiple times.
  - There is always a rootServiceContainer
